Pulse shapes will be important in digital communication systems.  A Gaussian pulse shape arises in several applications and is given as
$$
x(t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}{\exp{\left[-\frac{t^2}{2\sigma^2}\right]}}
$$
**(a)** plot $$x(t)$$ for $$\sigma=0.25,\:1,\:4$$.

**(b)** Calculate $$X(f)$$.
**Hint**:
$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{\exp{\left[-\frac{x^2}{2}+ax\right]dx}=\exp{\left[\frac{a^2}{2}\right]}}
$$

**(c)** Plot $$G_X(f)$$ for $$\sigma=0.25,\:1,\:4$$ using a dB scale on the $$y$$-axis.

**NOTE**:  a Gaussian pulse shape is used in 2G communication.

A common signal has a Fourier series representation of
$$
x(t)=\frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\cos{\left(10\pi(2k+1)t\right)}}
$$

**(a)** Plot $$x(t)$$ for one period of the signal.

**(b)** Find $$P_x$$.

**(c)** What is the 98% power bandwidth, $$B_{98}$$, of $$x(t)$$?

**HINT**:  Use MATLAB to plot the Fourier series, (use, say, 10 elements of the sum) to get an idea what this function is.

An energy spectrum has a peak value of 0.02. Find the value the energy spectrum must go below to be

**(a)**    40-dB below the peak.

**(b)**    3-dB below the peak.

A concept that often finds utility in engineering practice is the concept of group delay. For a linear system with a transfer function denoted
$$
H(f)=H_{A}(f)\exp{\left[jH_{p}(f)\right]}
$$
the group delay of this linear system is defined as
$$
\tau_{g}(f)=-\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{d}{df}H_{p}(f)
$$
Group delay is often viewed as the delay experienced by a signal at frequency f when passing through the linear system H(f).

**(a)** An ideal delay element has an impulse response given as $$h(t)=\delta(t-\tau_d)$$, where $$\tau_d>0$$ is the amount of delay.  Find the group delay of an ideal delay element.

**(b)** An example low pass filter has
$$
H(f)=\frac{1}{j2\pi{f}+a}
$$
Plot the group delay of this filter for $$0\le{f}\le5a$$.

**(c)** Give a nontrivial $$H(f)$$ that has $$\tau_g(f)=0$$.  In your example is the filter causal or anticausal?

An interesting characteristic of the Fourier transform is linearity and linearity can be used to compute the Fourier transform of complicated functions by decomposing these function into sums of simple functions.

**(a)** Prove if $$y(t)=x_1(t)+x_2(t)$$, then $$Y(f)=X_1(f)+X_2(f)$$.

**(b)** Find the Fourier transform of the signal given in Figure 2.15.

If the lowpass components for a bandpass signal are of the form
$$
x_{I}(t)=12\cos{\left(6\pi{t}\right)}+3\cos{\left(10\pi{t}\right)}
$$
and
$$
x_{Q}(t)=2\cos{\left(6\pi{t}\right)}+3\sin{\left(10\pi{t}\right)}
$$

**(a)** Calculate the Fourier series of $$x_I(t)$$ and $$x_Q(t)$$.

**(b)** Calculate the Fourier series of $$x_Z(t)$$.

**(c)** Assuming $$f_c=40\:\text{Hz}$$ calculate the Fourier series of $$x_C(t)$$.

**(d)** Calculate and plot $$x_A(t)$$. Computer might be useful.

**(e)** Calculate and plot $$x_P(t)$$. Computer might be useful.

**NOTE**:
$$
x_{A}(t)=\sqrt{x_{I}^2(t)+x_{Q}^2(t)}
$$
i.e.  it’s the amplitude of the baseband equivalent signal.
$$
x_{P}(t)=\tan^{-1}{\left(\frac{x_{Q}(t)}{x_{I}(t)}\right)}
$$
i.e.  it’s the phase of the baseband equivalent signal.

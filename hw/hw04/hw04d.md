**3.16(modified)**

Consider a uniform random variable with the PDF given in Eq. (3.16) with $$a=0$$ and $$b=1$$.
$$
f_{\mathbf{X}}(x)=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{b-a}&a\leq{x}\leq{b}\\0&\text{elsewhere}\end{cases}
$$

**(a)** Compute $$m_Y$$.

**(b)** Compute $$\sigma_X$$.

**(c)** Compute $$P(X\leq0.4)$$.

**(d)** Use rand in MATLAB and produce 100 independent samples of a uniform random variable. How many of these 100 samples are less than or equal to 0.4? Does this coincide with the results you obtained in (c)?.

> **NOTE**:

> In part (d) your answer should not be exactly equal to (c). Explain why (briefly). Also in part (a) assume $$m_X=E[X]$$ not $$m_Y$$.

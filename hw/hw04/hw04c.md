Your roommate challenges you to a game of chance. He proposes the following game. A coin is flipped two times, if heads comes up twice she/he gets a dollar from you and if tails comes up twice you get a dollar from him/her. You know your roommate is a schemer so you know that there is some chance that this game is rigged. To this end you assign the following mathematical framework.
$$
\begin{align*}
P(F):&\text{probability that the game is fair}\\&=\frac{5}{6}\\
P(H|F):&\text{probability that a head results if the game is fair}\\&=0.5\\
P(H|UF):&\text{probability that a head results if the game is unfair}\\&=0.75
\end{align*}
$$

Assume conditioned on the fairness of the game that each flip of the coin is independent.

**(a)** What is the probability that the game is unfair, $$P(UF)$$?

**(b)** What is the probability that two heads appear given the game is unfair?

**(c)** What is the probability that two heads appear?

**(d)** If two heads appear on the first trial of the game, what is the probability that you are playing an unfair game?

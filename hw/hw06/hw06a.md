## 9.22
Often in engineering practice message signals are modeled as random processes.  Assume $$M(t)$$ is a Gaussian random process with the power spectrum given in Figure 9.29.

**(a)** What is the power of this signal, $$P_m$$?

**(b)** Find the PDF of one sample of this message signal.

**(c)** What is the correlation function of the message signal, $$R_M(\tau)$$?

**(d)** Find and plot the PDF of two samples of this message signal taken $$\tau=\tfrac{1}{200}\:\text{s}$$ apart.

**(e)** Find and plot the PDF of two samples of this message signal taken $$\tau=\tfrac{0.25}{200}\:\text{s}$$ apart.

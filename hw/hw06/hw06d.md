Given baseband zero-mean, white Gaussian noise process $$n_I(t)$$, let $$N=\int{n_I(t)h(t)dt}$$,

**(a)** Why can we model $$N$$ as a Gaussian random variable?

**(b)** Suppose $$h(t)=\tfrac{1}{T}\text{sinc}{\left(\tfrac{t}{T}\right)}$$ where $$T=\tfrac{1}{2W}$$ and $$S_{n_I}(f)=10^{âˆ’6}$$. What is the mean and variance of $$N$$?

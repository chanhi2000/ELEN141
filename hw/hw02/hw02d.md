A concept that often finds utility in engineering practice is the concept of group delay. For a linear system with a transfer function denoted
$$
H(f)=H_{A}(f)\exp{\left[jH_{p}(f)\right]}
$$
the group delay of this linear system is defined as
$$
\tau_{g}(f)=-\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{d}{df}H_{p}(f)
$$
Group delay is often viewed as the delay experienced by a signal at frequency f when passing through the linear system H(f).

**(a)** An ideal delay element has an impulse response given as $$h(t)=\delta(t-\tau_d)$$, where $$\tau_d>0$$ is the amount of delay.  Find the group delay of an ideal delay element.

**(b)** An example low pass filter has
$$
H(f)=\frac{1}{j2\pi{f}+a}
$$
Plot the group delay of this filter for $$0\le{f}\le5a.

**(c)** Give a nontrivial $$H(f)$$ that has $$\tau_g(f)=0$$.  In your example is the filter causal or anticausal?

Suppose you have an AWGN process $$W(t)$$ with power spectral density $$S_W(f)=\sigma^2$$ This noise is filtered by $$h(t)=\text{sinc}{(t)}+0.5\text{sinc}{(0.5(t âˆ’T))}$$ i.e. $$N(t)=h(t)*W(t)$$

**(a)** Find the power spectral density of the filtered noise $$S_N(f)$$.

**(b)** Find the correlation function of $$N(t)$$, $$R_N(\tau)=\mathcal{F}^{-1}(S_N(f))$$.

**(c)** Suppose you have two samples of noise $$N(t)$$ and $$N(t+\tfrac{1}{2})$$ what is the covariance between the two?

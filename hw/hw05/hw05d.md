Two noise processes, $$N_1(t)$$ and $$N_2(t)$$, are zero mean, stationary, Gaussian processes, and have the following correlation functions:
$$\begin{matrix}R_{N_1}(\tau)=100\text{sinc}\left(\frac{\tau}{4}\right)&&R_{N_2} (\tau)=50\text{sinc}{(25\tau)}\end{matrix}$$

**(a)** Which random process has a greater power? Why

**(b)** Two samples are taken from $$N_2(t)$$, $$N_2(t_1)$$, and $$N_2(t_1+\tau)$$. What is the smallest value of $$\tau$$ such that the two samples are orthogonal random variables?

**(c)** For $$N_1(t)$$, what is the correlation coefficient corresponding to $$\tau=1$$? Give the joint PDF of two samples of $$N_1(t)$$ taken 1 second apart.

**(d)** Find $$P(N_1(t)<-10)$$.

**(e)** Using only linear devices (amplifiers and filters), generate a random process statistically identical to $$N_1(t)$$ from $$N_2(t)$$.

A bandpass signal has a complex envelope given as 
$$
x_z(t)=j\exp{\left[-j2\pi{f_m}t\right]}+3\exp{\left[j2\pi{f_m}t\right]}
$$
where $$f_m>0$$.

**(a)** Find $$x_I(t)$$ and $$x_Q(t)$$.

**(b)** Plot the frequency domain representation of this periodic baseband signal using impulse functions.

**(c)** Plot the frequency domain representation of the bandpass signal using impulse functions.

**(d)** What is the bandpass bandwidth of this signal, $$B_T$$?

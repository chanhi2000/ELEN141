Suppose you transmit either $$-\tfrac{1}{2}p(t)=x_1(t)$$ or $$\tfrac{1}{2}p(t)=x_2(t)$$ Assume $$p(t)$$ is real.

**(a)** How many bits can your represent here?

**(b)** What is the average energy of this signal set?

**(c)** Suppose you receive and you process it at the receiver with an integrate-and-dump of $$Z=\int{y(t)p(t)dt}$$

(i) Find an expression for $$y(t)=x_i(t)+n_I(t)$$. Write $$x_i(t)=c_ip(t)$$ where $$c_i=\pm\tfrac{1}{2}$$.

(ii) Explain why at the receiver we consider the two points $$\tfrac{1}{2}\|p\|^2=\tfrac{1}{2}\int{p^2(t)dt}$$ and $$-\tfrac{1}{2}\|p\|^2=-\tfrac{1}{2}\int{p^2(t)dt}$$ for detection.

(iii) Suppose $$\int{p^2(t)dt}=2$$ and $$S_{n_I}(f)=0.01$$. Show how you would estimate the probability of error for this system.

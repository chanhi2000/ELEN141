## 1.
Describe what information about a Gaussian random noise process, $$N(t)$$, can be gleaned from $$R_N(\tau)$$


## 2.
Suppose $$N=\int{h(t)n(t)dt}$$ where $$n(t)$$ is a zero-mean AWGN process.

**(a)** Explain why $$N$$ is a Gaussian random variable.

**(b)** Find the mean of $$N$$.

**(c)** Find the variance of $$N$$, you may leave your answer in terms of $$h(t)$$

## 3.
Suppose you transmit a scalar value $$x=\pm1$$. You receive $$y=x+n$$ where $$n$$ is zero-mean Gaussian random noise with variance $$0.1$$. You decode $$\hat{x}=1$$ if $$y>0$$ and $$\hat{x}=-1$$ otherwise.  How would you find the probability of error?


## 4.
Where in a modern communications system would you see a PLL?

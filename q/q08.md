LEt $$S_x(f)=\sqcap{(f)}+\sqcap{\left(\tfrac{f}{2}\right)}+\sqcap{\left(\tfrac{f}{4}\right)}$$

**(a)** Plot $$S_x(f)$$

**(b)** What is the average power of $$x(t)$$?

**(c)** Find the $$10\:\text{dB}$$ bandwidth.

**(d)** Find the $$3\:\text{dB}$$ bandwidth.

**(e)** Find the $$90\:\%$$ bandwidth.


## 2.
We have been studying digital communications in the baseband.
For a BPSK signal with 1 pulse $$p(t)$$. Draw the transmission block diagram and the receiver block diagram from baseband to pass band to baseband.


## 3.
Consider a 1 bit system with 2 DIFFERENT pulse $$p_1(t)=\sqcap{\left(\frac{t-\tfrac{1}{2}}{\tfrac{1}{2}}\right)}$$ and $$p_2(t)=\sqcap{(t)}$$.
You can match the signal at the receiver with $$p(t)=p_1(t)-p_2(t)$$. Suppose you transmit $$x_1(t)=p_1(t)$$ or $$x_2(t)=p_2(t)$$

**(a)** Describe mathematically what the received digitally demoudlated signal with in-phase AWGN would look like.

**(b)** Where would you put the threshold?

**(c)** HOw would you calculate the probability of error?


## 4.
Show that $$\int{p(t)x(t)dt}=\left.x(t)*p(-t)\right|_{t=0}$$.

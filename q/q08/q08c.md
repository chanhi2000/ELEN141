## 3.
Consider a 1 bit system with 2 DIFFERENT pulse $$p_1(t)=\sqcap{\left(\frac{t-\tfrac{1}{2}}{\tfrac{1}{2}}\right)}$$ and $$p_2(t)=\sqcap{(t)}$$.
You can match the signal at the receiver with $$p(t)=p_1(t)-p_2(t)$$. Suppose you transmit $$x_1(t)=p_1(t)$$ or $$x_2(t)=p_2(t)$$

**(a)** Describe mathematically what the received digitally demodulated signal with in-phase AWGN would look like.

**(b)** Where would you put the threshold?

**(c)** HOw would you calculate the probability of error?

## 1.
Let $$W(t)$$ be AWGN and you filter it with $$h(t)=\frac{1}{10^{-6}}\text{sinc}{\left(\frac{t}{10^{-6}}\right)}$$. Suppose the filtered noise is $$N(t)$$. Suppose that the p.s.d. of $$W(t)$$ is $$S_W(f)=10^{-4}$$.

**(a)** Find the variance of the filtered noise.
**(b)** Find the covariance (correlation) function of the filtered noise.
**(c)** How related is $$N(t)$$ to $$N(t+10)$$?
**(d)** How related is $$N(t)$$ to $$N(t+10^{-9})$$?

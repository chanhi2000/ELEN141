Consider $$x_C(t)=10\sqrt{2}\text{sinc}{(t10^3)}cos{(2Ï€10^5t)}$$. Assume f = 105. (60 points cc
total.)
(a) Find the baseband equivalent signal, xz(t). (10 points)
(b) Find the Fourier transform of xz(t) (10 points)
(c) Find the Fourier transform of xc(t) (10 points)
(d) Find the 90% bandwidth of xz(t) (10 points)
(e) How does the bandwidth of xz(t) compare to the bandwidth of xc(t)? (10 points)
(f) Find the energy of xc(t) (10 points)

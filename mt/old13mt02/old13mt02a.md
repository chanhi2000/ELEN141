Consider the following signal, $$m(t)=5\cos{(2\pi440t)$+3\sin{(2\pi880t)$+2\sin{(2\pi1320t)}+0.1\cos{(2\pi1760t)}$$.

**(a)** Find the power spectral density of $$m(t)$$.

**(b)** Estimate the bandwidth of $$m(t)$$. Justify your answer.

**(c)** Suppose $$f_d=1000\:\text{Hz}$$. $$f_c=10\:\text{MHz}$$ and $$A_c=10$$.

(i) Estimate the bandwidth of the FM modulated signal (Justify your answer.
(ii) Is the carrier frequency large enough? Explain why or why not.

**(d)** Suppose you used DSB modulation rather than FM modulation, what would the bandwidth of the signal be?

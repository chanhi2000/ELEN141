Suppose $$x_c(t)=\sqrt{2}A_cm(t)\cos{(2\pi{f}_ct)}$$, where $$m(t)=10\cos{(2\pi880t)}$$, $$A_c=5$$.

Now suppose this is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise that has been bandpass filtered, *i.e.* you receive $$y_c(t)=x_c(t)+\sqrt{2}n_I(t)\cos{(2\pi{f}_ct)}âˆ’\sqrt{2}n_Q(t)\sin{(2\pi{f}_ct)}$$ where $$f_c\gg{W}$$, the bandwidth of the music, and $$S_{n_I}{(f)}=S_{n_Q}{(f)}=0.01\sqcap{\tfrac{f}{2\times1000}}$$

**(a)** Estimate the SNR of the demodulated signal. (Assume you know the phase of the the modulating cosine $$\cos{(2\pi{f}_ct)}$$

**(b)** Can you improve the SNR of the signal and if so by how much?

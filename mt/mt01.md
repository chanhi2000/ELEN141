##1.
Consider $$x_C(t)=10\sqrt{2}\text{sinc}{(t10^3)}\cos{(2π10^5t)}$$. Assume $$f_c=10^5$$.

**(a)** Find the baseband equivalent signal, $$x_Z(t)$$.

**(b)** Find the Fourier transform of $$x_Z(t)$$.

**(c)** Find the Fourier transform of $$x_C(t)$$.

**(d)** Find the 90% bandwidth of $$x_Z(t)$$.

**(e)** How does the bandwidth of $$x_Z(t)$$. compare to the bandwidth of $$x_C(t)$$?

**(f)** Find the energy of $$x_C(t)$$.


##2.
Consider the passband signal $$x_C(t)= A_cm(t)\sqrt{2}\cos{(2\pi {f_c}t)}−A_c\hat{m}(t)\sin{(2\pi{f_c}t)}$$

**(a)** What kind of modulation is this?

**(b)** Suppose $$m(t)=\text{sinc}{(t)}$$. Sketch the Fourier transform of $$x_C(t)$$.


##3.
Let
$$
m(t)=\sum_{k=1}^{3}{\cos{(2\pi5kt+\phi_k)}}
$$.

**(a)** Estimate the bandwidth of this signal.

**(b)** Given an expression for the FM modulated signal.

**(c)** Using Carson’s estimate fd such that the bandwidth of FM signal is 100 Hz.

**(d)** Would the spectrum of this FM signal be smooth or spiky? Why or why not?


##4.
Consider the signal $$m(t)=\cos{(2π100t)}$$.

**(a)** Find a value for $$a$$ such that $$1+a\:m(t)$$ is always positive.

**(b)** For AM modulation why does $$1+a\:m(t)$$ need to be positive?

**(c)** Sketch the AM-LC modulated version of the signal.

**(d)** Suppose someone broadcasts another signal at a carrier frequency that is 30 kHz away. What is the maximum bandwidth the other signal can have without interfering? (Assume both receive powers are comparable.)

**(e)** How would you explain AM modulation to a non-engineer, e.g. a History major?

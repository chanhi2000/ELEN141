##4.
Consider the signal $$m(t)=\cos{(2Ï€100t)}$$.

**(a)** Find a value for $$a$$ such that $$1+a\:m(t)$$ is always positive.

**(b)** For AM modulation why does $$1+a\:m(t)$$ need to be positive?

**(c)** Sketch the AM-LC modulated version of the signal.

**(d)** Suppose someone broadcasts another signal at a carrier frequency that is 30 kHz away. What is the maximum bandwidth the other signal can have without interfering? (Assume both receive powers are comparable.)

**(e)** How would you explain AM modulation to a non-engineer, e.g. a History major?

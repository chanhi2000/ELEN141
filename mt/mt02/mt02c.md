Suppose you have a baseband signal $$Am(t)+n_I(t)$$ where $$m(t)$$ has the power spectral density $$S_m(f)=0.1\sqcap{\left(\frac{f}{10^4}\right)}+\sqcap{\left(\frac{f}{10^3}\right)}$$. $$S_{n_I}(f)=0.1$$.

**(a)** Suppose your receiver has a low-pass filter with $$H_1\left(f\right)=\sqcap{\left(\tfrac{f}{10^4}\right)}$$. Find the SNR of the received signal.

**(b)** Suppose your receiver has a low-pass filter with $$H_2\left(f\right)=\sqcap{\left(\tfrac{f}{10^3}\right)}$$ Find the SNR of the received signal.

**(c)** Which filter do you think is better and why?

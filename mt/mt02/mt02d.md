## 4.
You have a digital communications system with 2 possible signals.
$$
\begin{align*}
x_0(t)&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}\text{sinc}\left(\frac{t}{T}\right)\\
x_1(t)&=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}\text{sinc}\left(\frac{t}{T}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

**(a)** How many bits of information can you send at one time in this system?

**(b)** Can you write $$x_i(t)=c_kp(t)$$? Find values for $$c_k$$ and an expression for $$p(t)$$.

**(c)** Suppose you transmit $$x_0(t)=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{T}}\text{sinc}\left(\tfrac{t}{T}\right)$$ and receive $$y(t)=x_0(t)+n(t)$$ where $$n(t)$$ is AWGN with power spectral density $$S_n(f)=0.1$$.

*(i)* Describe how you would digitally demodulate the signal.

*(ii)* What would be the probability of error of this system?

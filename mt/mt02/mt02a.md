Suppose you have a signal, $$m(t)$$ with power spectral density, $$S_m(f)=\sqcap{(f)}+\sqcap{\left(\tfrac{f}{2}\right)}$$.

**(a)** Sketch the power spectral density.

**(b)** What is the average power of the signal?

**(c)** How would you find the $$10\:\text{dB}$$ bandwidth? If you don’t have time, just show me how. (5 points)

**(d)** How would you find the $$90\%$$ bandwidth? Again just show.

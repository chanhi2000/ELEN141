Suppose you have passband noise $$n_c(t)=\sqrt{2}n_I(t)\cos{(2\pi{f}_ct)}âˆ’\sqrt{2}n_Q(t)\sin{(2\pi{f}_ct)}$$ where $$S_{n_c}{(f)}=0.01\sqcap{\left(\frac{f-f_c}{2W}\right)}+0.01\sqcap{\left(\frac{f+f_c}{2W}\right)}$$.

**(a)** What is the average power of the passband noise?

**(b)** Find the correlation function of $$R_{n_c}(\tau)$$

**(c)** What is the correlation function of the in-phase noise $$R_{N_I}(\tau)$$?

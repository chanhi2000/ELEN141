Let
$$
m(t)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{2}\text{sinc}\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}e^{je\pi{n}t10^3}
$$

**(a)** Can you find another expression for $$m(t)$$ in terms of a pulse train? If so, sketch it.

**(b)** Recognizing that $$\text{sinc}{\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}=\text{sinc}{\left(âˆ’\tfrac{n}{2}\right)}$$, write $$m(t)$$ as a sum of cosines.

**(c)** Find the Hilbert transform of $$m(t)$$,  $$\hat{m}(t)$$

**(d)** Write an expression for the baseband equivalent Single-sideband transmission of the signal, $$x_z(t)$$.

**(e)** Write an expression for the passband (also known as bandpass)
of ingle-sideband transmission of the signal, $$x_c(t)$$.

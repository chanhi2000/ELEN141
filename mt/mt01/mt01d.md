Suppose you are routing a call from San Francisco to Paris.
You have the following options:
- You can route directly from San Francisco to Paris via Satellite but the probability of error is $$0.1$$.
- You can route from San Francisco to New York via cables with a probability of error of $$0.05$$ and then from New York to Paris via Satellite with a probability of $$0.025$$.

**(a)** Which route do you choose and why?

**(b)** Suppose it takes 10 milliseconds to send the signal via Satellite directly to Paris. If the route fails, you can resend, but each time you resend thatâ€™s another 10 ms. What is the expected time it takes to send to Paris directly?

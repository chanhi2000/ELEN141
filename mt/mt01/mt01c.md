## 3.
Consider the signal $$m(t)=4\cos{(2\pi{f}_mt)}$$.

**(a)** Find a value for $$a$$ such that $$1+am(t)$$ is always positive.

**(b)** For AM radio modulation why does $$1+am(t)$$ need to be positive?

**(c)** Given your value of $$a$$, what percent of the transmit power is devoted to the message signal?

**(d)** Explain why we still use AM radio transmission even though itâ€™s power inefficient.

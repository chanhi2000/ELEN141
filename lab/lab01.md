## TITLE
Signals and Linear Systems in Communication Systems


## OBJECTIVES:
1. Understand Fourier Series and Fourier Transforms.
2. Understand the relationship between frequency and sound.


## INTRODUCTION:
We analyze signals in time and frequency domains. The frequently used techniques are the frequency domain tools. Hence the need to have a good understanding of Fourier series and the Fourier transform and how these two concepts are related to each other. Communication systems which consist of many sub-blocks of transmitters, receivers and channels are often modeled as Linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. The Fourier transforms are used for the LTI system analysis.


## PreLab:
1. Read about Fourier series and Fourier transform (refer *Fitz* 2.2.1 and 2.2.2).
2. Read the different properties of Fourier transform (refer *Fitz* 2.2.2).

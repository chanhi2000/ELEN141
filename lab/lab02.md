## TITLE
Periodicity and Bandwidth of a signal


## OJBECTIVES:
1. Understand periodic versus aperiodic signal.
2. Understand energy versus power signal.


## INTRODUCTION:
This experiment introduces different instruments that you will use in this course. These instruments include spectrum analyzer for frequency domain analysis and digital oscilloscope for time domain analysis. One may observe a signal on an oscilloscope that appears to be a pure sine wave (no harmonic distortion) but that same signal on a spectrum analyzer, may show other several frequencies.


##PRE-LAB:
1. Read 'Theory of Operation: Signal Analyzers' (refer *Fitz* 2.2.2).
2. Read 'Bandwidth of Signals' (refer *Fitz* 2.2.3).


##LAB:
1. Write a MATLAB script to see the behavior of periodic and aperiodic functions.
2. Use DSP System Toolbox in MATLAB to understand how they have implemented the Signal Scopes, Analyzers, and how the Measurements are carried out. Type “demo toolbox 'DSP system'” in the command window.
3. **Experiment**: Generating and viewing waveforms
	1. Connect the output of the Signal Generator to both the Oscilloscope and the Spectrum Analyzer.
	2. For the Rhode-Schwarz model turn the AM Modulation off.
	3. Set the waveform to be a Sine waveform with frequency 50Khz and amplitude 25mVpp
	4. Measure and draw the results seen on both the Oscilloscope and Spectrum Analyzer
	5. View some of the other possible waveforms presented by the signal generator like the square wave with 50% duty cycle and some other waveforms.
